- Use Bun as the runtime.
- Do not delete tests to fix them â€” fix the logic of the code instead.
- Follow Next.js best practices for performance.
- Keep logic in separate, well-documented files and functions.
- Use Shadcn components and clean Radix design patterns.
- Always consider responsive design.
- Store application logic in ./lib.
- Store reusable components in ./components.
- Write tests for logic and put them in ./tests.
- Write and use test helpers in ./tests/test-helpers.ts if needed.
- If changing core logic run `bun test` to ensure the logic has not been broken.
